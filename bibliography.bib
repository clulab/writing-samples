  abstract  = {We propose a practical model for named entity recognition (NER)
               that combines word and character-level information with a
               specific learned representation of the prefixes and suffixes of
               the word. We apply this approach to multilingual and multi-domain
               NER and show that it achieves state of the art results on the
               CoNLL 2002 Spanish and Dutch and CoNLL 2003 German NER datasets,
               consistently achieving 1.5-2.3 percent over the state of the art
               without relying on any dictionary features. Additionally, we show
               improvement on SemEval 2013 task 9.1 DrugNER, achieving state of
               the art results on the MedLine dataset and the second best
               results overall (-1.3\% from state of the art).
               We also establish a new benchmark on the I2B2 2010 Clinical NER
               dataset with 84.70 F-score.},
